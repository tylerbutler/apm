<!--
Load ONLY at synthesis time. Fill one advisory comment, under 250 lines,
ASCII only, retaining all headings and six persona sections. Inactive
conditional lenses say "Not activated -- <reason>". The caller is the
sole writer; direct invocation returns this without posting.
Fill the v2 JSON block only when the activation card has `json: on`.
Default is `json: off`: omit the JSON receipt. Never post that JSON
(or any machine fence) on the GitHub issue. The public comment is
prose plus the HTML receipt. The JSON is advisory data, not a
label/milestone write instruction.

## Triage recommendation

<accept | needs-design | decline-with-reason | duplicate-of | defer-later | auto-handle>

**Recommendation only, not scope approval.** A responsible human maintainer
must approve the scope and review contact before implementation. Labels,
automated advice, and silence are not approval or a release commitment.

## Proposed classification

<Only useful type/area/theme labels from the label contract, or none.
Existing human choices stay unchanged; name conflicts rather than replacing them.>

## Proposed scope brief

- **Scope:** <bounded deliverable or the missing information>
- **Done when:** <observable completion criteria>
- **Exclusions:** <important non-goals, or none identified>
- **Review needs:** <expertise and capacity still to confirm; no invented assignment>

## Suggested next action

<One concrete discussion/reproduction/design/human-review step. Do not invite
implementation based on the recommendation alone.>

## Suggested issue comment

```markdown
<Warm, specific, evidence-grounded reply. Explain the recommendation and
uncertainty. Link relevant documentation when useful. Do not imply that the
project has accepted, assigned, or release-targeted this work.>
```
