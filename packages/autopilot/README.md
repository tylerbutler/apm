# Autopilot

Maintainer map for the local autopilot packages. Not product docs.
Humans still accept scope, merge, and release. These skills advise or
implement only inside that human gate.

On disk: `packages/autopilot/<package-name>/`. Invoke by skill name,
not path. Deployed copies stay flat under `.agents/skills/`.

Named list = explicit request. Empty queue = stop.

## Layout

`autopilot-{domain}-{stage}-{role}`

| Domain | Stage | Scheduler | Worker |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| issue | triage | yes | yes |
| issue | delivery | yes | yes |
| pr | triage | yes | yes |
| pr | review | yes | yes (advisory) |
| pr | merge | no | yes (summon by name) |

Schedulers select and fan out (default 2 concurrent slots, drain the
full selected list). Before any spawn they emit a keep-set and
drop-set table: number, kind, labels, rationale, slot. Missing
column or blank rationale -> stop. Worker sessions are named
`{Domain} {stage} #{n}` (`Issue triage #2993`, `PR triage #1017`,
`Issue delivery #2902`, `PR review #2741`). No GitHub title. Workers
do one item. Schedulers never comment, label, assign, or request
reviewers.

## Shared rules

- Unattended (Agentic Workflow / gh-aw / Actions): never assign, never
  request reviewers.
- Actor-session: delivery assigns `@me`; standalone review requests
  `@me` as reviewer, never assignee. Skip self-review if the operator
  is the PR author.
- CODEOWNERS `reviewRequests` are runtime authority. Additive only.
  Never contradict. Never convert a failed reviewer request into an
  assignee write. PR review also applies the CODEOWNERS last-comment
  gate: read the last CODEOWNER comment as conditions and evaluate
  them against later comments AND labels on the PR and linked
  issues. Stop only when those conditions are unmet or unclear. Do
  not stop when the asked work is already done.
- Triage and review read the full conversation (paginate to
  exhaustion). Partial context = stop, no fresh advice.
- Human decision labels are never written by these skills:
  `status/needs-triage`, `status/needs-design`, `status/accepted`.
  Exception: PR triage writes `status/deferred` when the PR has no
  same-repo linked issue labelled `status/accepted`. Do not overwrite
  `status/accepted` on the PR.
- Labels, comments, and silence are not authorization.
- Each canonical skill emits an Enter card before work and an Exit
  receipt after. Missing field = stop. Schedulers are `write: off`.
  Workers default `write: on`; `write: off` returns the template only.
  Triage workers default `json: off`. Omitted `json` is not a
  missing-field stop. `json: on` is an internal receipt only, never
  posted on GitHub.

## Labels

| Label | Kind | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `triage/requested` | request | Fresh issue-triage pass. Re-apply to run again. |
| `triage/recommended` | processing | Advice posted. Not acceptance. |
| `status/triaged` | legacy read | Same as completed advice. Sweep fetch excludes it. Do not write. |
| `status/needs-triage` | human | Still waiting on a human. Not a trigger. |
| `status/needs-design` | human | Design first. |
| `status/accepted` | human | Human agrees to act. Required for delivery and PR review/merge. |
| `status/deferred` | human | Not now. Not accepted. |
| `panel-review` | request | Fresh PR-review pass. Re-apply (remove + add) to run again. |
| `type/*` `area/*` `theme/*` | classification | Optional allowlist only. Preserve human choices. |
| `panel-approved` / `panel-rejected` | leftover | Sweep on advisory review. Do not write. |

Contract file:
`autopilot-issue-triage-worker/assets/label-contract.json`
(PR triage ships the same contract).

## Skills

### `autopilot-issue-triage-scheduler`

Selects issues. Compose `autopilot-issue-triage-worker` one issue per
slot. Trigger: `triage/requested`, a named list, or `queue-all` sweep.
Does not consume `status/needs-triage`. Helpers:
`scripts/fetch_queue.py` then `scripts/triage_state.py` (sweep fetch
excludes `triage/recommended` and `status/triaged`; completed-advice
skip, two per author, oldest first, cap 10).

### `autopilot-issue-triage-worker`

Advises one already-selected issue. One comment plus
`triage/recommended` and optional classification. May clear
`triage/requested`. Never assigns. An `accept` recommendation is not
acceptance.

### `autopilot-issue-delivery-scheduler`

Selects maintainer-accepted issues (`status/accepted` or a named
bounded accept), including bot-authored issues once accepted.
Selector `bugs` also requires `type/bug`. `triage/recommended`
is not authorization. Workers re-check
`scripts/governance/eligibility.cjs`. Unattended ORIGIN never
implements.

### `autopilot-issue-delivery-worker`

Implements one already-selected issue. Queue signal is not permission.
Needs fresh human-scope evidence. Actor-session: assign `@me` on the
issue and any fix PR before edits. Do not steal. Do not request that
actor as a reviewer.

### `autopilot-pr-triage-scheduler`

Selects open PRs (named list or `queue-open` sweep). Sweep fetch
excludes `triage/recommended` and `status/triaged`. Classifies
incoming PRs, including those with no linked issue. Never merges,
never runs review or merge workers.

### `autopilot-pr-triage-worker`

Classifies one PR. One comment plus processing/classification. Notes
CODEOWNERS owners in the comment; does not change review requests.
`ready-for-review` is not merge approval and is not a request to run
PR review.

### `autopilot-pr-review-scheduler`

Selects PRs labelled `panel-review` or `status/accepted` on the PR
(or a named list). Never lists all open PRs. `panel-review` remains
the only request trigger. Drops any PR that is not `status/accepted`
on the PR or a same-repo linked issue: no spawn, no comment, no
label change.
Also drops when the CODEOWNERS last-comment gate finds unmet or
unclear conditions. Named list does not bypass that gate. Never
composes `autopilot-pr-merge-worker`.

### `autopilot-pr-review-worker`

Advisory multi-persona review of one PR. Requires `status/accepted`
(else silent stop; may clear `panel-review`). Re-checks the
CODEOWNERS last-comment gate before panelists. One recommendation
comment. Does not gate merge. Actor-session may request `@me` as a
supplemental reviewer.

### `autopilot-pr-merge-worker`

Drive one already-selected PR toward mergeable. Summon by name. The
review scheduler never spawns it. Same accepted gate as review
(silent stop if missing). Folds in the PR's stated scope. Never
requests the implementer as a reviewer.

## Agentic Workflows

- Issue triage: `.github/workflows/triage-panel.md` (label
  `triage/requested`).
- PR review: `.github/workflows/pr-review-panel.md` (label
  `panel-review`). Still a hard skill stop without `status/accepted`.
