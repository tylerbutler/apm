# Autopilot Scheduler Issue Triage

Activate **autopilot-issue-triage-scheduler**. Targets: **${input:targets}**

1. Named issues = explicit request. `queue-all` = sweep (oldest
   first, max 10, max two per author) using
   `fetch_queue.py` then `triage_state.py`. Sweep excludes
   `triage/recommended` and `status/triaged` at fetch.
2. Fan out through this run's isolated pool (default 2).
3. Never share slots with delivery, PR-review, or PR-triage.
4. Never implement. Never assign.
