APM works without tokens for public packages on github.com. Authentication is needed for private repositories, enterprise hosts (`*.ghe.com`, GHES), GitLab (private or API access), and Azure DevOps.

## CLI bootstrap and release lookup

Installing or updating the CLI queries public release metadata authenticated-first when an environment token is available, with narrowly scoped anonymous recovery for a rejected token. This is separate from private-package authentication and anonymous-first public-package Git operations. See [Public release metadata](../installation/#public-release-metadata) for token precedence and retry restrictions.

## How APM resolves authentication

Public `github.com` packages need no token configuration. APM tries HTTPS repository operations anonymously before resolving credentials.

The first attempt has no authorization header, GitHub token environment variable, or active Git credential helper. APM preserves caller-supplied Git config, including URL rewrites, CA settings, and non-credential HTTP headers, while removing credential-bearing headers and helpers. A 401, 403, 404, or equivalent Git authentication failure unlocks the credential chain below; DNS, TLS, timeout, and GitHub throttle failures do not.

APM resolves ordinary tokens per `(host, port, org)` scope. When a private `github.com` fallback asks the credential helper for a repository path, that path also scopes the cache entry. APM then walks a **host-class-specific** chain until it finds a token:

1. **GitHub-class hosts** (`github.com`, `*.ghe.com`, GHES via `GITHUB_HOST`): **Per-org env var** `GITHUB_APM_PAT_{ORG}` (when an org slug applies), then **global** `GITHUB_APM_PAT` -> `GITHUB_TOKEN` -> `GH_TOKEN`, then **GitHub CLI active account** (`gh auth token --hostname <host>`, silently skipped if `gh` is not installed or not logged in for the host), then host-specific **git credential helper**.
2. **GitLab-class hosts** (`gitlab.com`, or FQDNs listed via `GITLAB_HOST` / `APM_GITLAB_HOSTS`): **only** `GITLAB_APM_PAT` -> `GITLAB_TOKEN`, then host-specific **git credential helper**. GitHub token env vars are **not** used for GitLab (including `GITHUB_APM_PAT`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and `GH_TOKEN`, and `GITHUB_APM_PAT_{ORG}` for group/namespace paths).
3. **ADO-class hosts**: Azure DevOps Services (`dev.azure.com`, `*.visualstudio.com`) uses **only** `ADO_APM_PAT` -> AAD bearer via `az`; Azure DevOps Server hosts listed via `ADO_HOST` / `APM_ADO_HOSTS` use **only** `ADO_APM_PAT`. GitHub and GitLab token env vars are **not** used for ADO-class hosts.
4. **Generic hosts** (other FQDNs such as Bitbucket): host-specific **git credential helper** or unauthenticated/public access -- **no** GitHub, GitLab, or ADO platform env vars.

If a GitHub- or GitLab-class token fails, supported paths may retry the native
Git credential chain. No ADO Git path invokes native credential helpers: Azure
DevOps Services retries a rejected `ADO_APM_PAT` with the Azure CLI bearer,
while Azure DevOps Server remains PAT-only. Hosts with public repositories may
then allow unauthenticated access according to their provider policy.

Results are cached per-process. Validation, persistent Git cache population, and later fetch phases for the same private repository reuse one path-scoped fallback instead of prompting repeatedly, while another repository can resolve its own credential. APM never writes the credential into persistent cache keys or stored remote URLs. All token-bearing requests use HTTPS.

### Git URL rewrite safety

APM preserves safe `url.<base>.insteadOf` rules, including HTTPS-to-SSH and
local mirror rewrites. Before each dependency Git operation that consumes a
remote URL, it rejects credentials, downgrades to insecure transports such as
`http://` or `git://`, remote-helper syntax such as `ext::` or `https::`, and
every cross-host network target, regardless of host class. A managed HTTPS
credential also cannot cross a scheme, host, or port boundary. Same-host SSH and
local-mirror selections remain credential-free.

If a rewrite is rejected, inspect the matching rules first:

```bash
git config --show-origin --get-regexp '^url\..*\.insteadOf$'
```

APM only runs the `http.extraHeader` URL-match probe when the effective
rewritten URL is HTTP(S). Safe same-host SSH rewrites remain
credential-free, so a same-host SSH target does not use that probe.
Confirm that the longest matching rule keeps the target on the same host
and does not introduce credentials or an insecure transport, then retry.
If a rewrite that should be safe still cannot be verified, fix the
matching rule or the config that sets it before removing a rule that may
be safe.

If the selected rewrite is a `file://` mirror and the clone fails, verify that
the local path exists and is readable. Fix that rewrite or remove it if the
mirror is stale; configuring an SSH key or token does not repair a missing
local mirror.

APM snapshots the effective Git config, validates the longest matching rewrite,
and freezes the result for the child process. It drops malformed ambient HTTP
headers before applying an anonymous empty-header fence or one path-scoped
AuthResolver header. Dependency clones ignore Git templates and checkout hooks.

## Token lookup
### GitHub-class hosts (`github.com`, `*.ghe.com`, GHES via `GITHUB_HOST`)

| Priority | Variable | Scope | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | `GITHUB_APM_PAT_{ORG}` | Per-org | Org name uppercased, hyphens -> underscores |
| 2 | `GITHUB_APM_PAT` | Global | Falls back to git credential helpers if rejected |
| 3 | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Global | Often set in GitHub Actions |
| 4 | `GH_TOKEN` | Global | Often set by `gh auth login` |
| 5 | `gh auth token --hostname <host>` | Per-host | Active `gh auth login` account; silently skipped if `gh` is missing or not logged in |
| 6 | `git credential fill` | Per-host | System credential manager, OS keychain |

### GitLab-class hosts (`gitlab.com`, `GITLAB_HOST`, `APM_GITLAB_HOSTS`)

| Priority | Variable | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | `GITLAB_APM_PAT` | Preferred dedicated variable for APM + GitLab |
| 2 | `GITLAB_TOKEN` | CI / automation-friendly name (`CI_JOB_TOKEN`, etc.) |
| 3 | `git credential fill` | Host-scoped HTTPS credentials |

**GitLab exclusion:** GitHub PAT env vars (`GITHUB_APM_PAT`, `GITHUB_APM_PAT_{ORG}`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`) are **never** chosen for GitLab-class hosts — even if set — because they commonly appear in unrelated contexts (for example Actions) and must not be sent to GitLab as `PRIVATE-TOKEN` or HTTPS credentials.

### Generic hosts (e.g. Bitbucket, self-hosted SCM that is not GitLab-class)

| Priority | Source | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `git credential fill` | Configure credentials for that host in git |

### Generic marketplace Git transport

Marketplace Git fetches use `AuthResolver` host classification with a
transport-specific credential policy. Generic HTTPS may use its native Git credential helper, while
APM remains noninteractive (`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`). Platform token variables,
`GIT_TOKEN`, and environment-based authorization-header channels are removed
before that fetch.

| Remote | Credential posture |
| --- | --- |
| Generic HTTPS | Native Git credential helpers are available. |
| Generic HTTP | Git fetches isolate configuration and suppress all credential channels. Hosted `marketplace.json` registration requires HTTPS. |
| Generic SSH | Token-free, with `BatchMode=yes` and `ConnectTimeout=30`. |
| GitHub, GitLab, ADO | Continue using the hardened provider-specific environment. |

APM rejects an HTTPS Git URL that Git configuration would rewrite to
`http://` before any credential helper or provider credential is used.

For Azure DevOps Services, APM resolves `ADO_APM_PAT`, then an Entra ID
(AAD) bearer token from Azure CLI (`az`). Azure DevOps Server uses
`ADO_APM_PAT` only. See [Azure DevOps](#azure-devops).

For Artifactory registry proxies, use `PROXY_REGISTRY_TOKEN`. See [Registry proxy (Artifactory)](#registry-proxy-artifactory).

For dedicated APM registries (`registries:` block in `apm.yml`), use `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_{NAME}`. See [Registry tokens](#registry-tokens) below.

For Copilot/runtime token variables (`GITHUB_COPILOT_PAT`, etc.), see [Authentication (consumer ramp)](../../consumer/authentication/).

### Configuration variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `APM_GIT_CREDENTIAL_TIMEOUT` | Timeout in seconds for `git credential fill` (default: 60, max: 180) |
| `GITHUB_HOST` | Default host for bare package names (e.g., GHES hostname) |
| `ADO_HOST` | One on-prem Azure DevOps Server FQDN, without a port or path (e.g., `ado.company.com`) |
| `APM_ADO_HOSTS` | Comma-separated list of on-prem ADO Server FQDNs, without ports or paths |

## Multi-org setup

When your manifest pulls from multiple GitHub organizations, use per-org env vars:

```bash
export GITHUB_APM_PAT_CONTOSO=ghp_token_for_contoso
export GITHUB_APM_PAT_FABRIKAM=ghp_token_for_fabrikam
```

The org name comes from the dependency reference — `contoso/my-package` checks `GITHUB_APM_PAT_CONTOSO`. Naming rules:

- Uppercase the org name
- Replace hyphens with underscores
- `contoso-microsoft` → `GITHUB_APM_PAT_CONTOSO_MICROSOFT`

Per-org tokens take priority over global tokens. Use this when different orgs require different PATs (e.g., separate SSO authorizations).

## Multi-account Git Credential Manager

APM forwards the repository path to `git credential fill`, so [Git Credential Manager (GCM)](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager) can automatically pick the right GitHub account per organization -- no account-picker prompt. Existing single-account setups are unaffected: if `credential.useHttpPath` is not enabled, git credential helpers ignore the `path` attribute and match per host only.

To opt in, enable path-aware matching once:

```bash
git config --global credential.useHttpPath true
```

GCM (v2.1+) matches credential URLs by **prefix**, so a single config entry per org typically covers every repo under that org:

```bash
git config --global credential.https://github.com/acme.username your-acme-account
git config --global credential.https://github.com/personal-org.username your-personal-account
```

With the entries above, fetches against `acme/widgets`, `acme/payments`, and any other `acme/*` repo all resolve to `your-acme-account` without per-repo configuration. Other credential helpers (and older GCM versions) may require an exact path match -- consult your helper's documentation if a per-org entry is not picked up.

### Seeing an account picker mid-install?

If `apm install` triggers a GCM account-picker dialog while resolving a private repo:

1. Confirm `credential.useHttpPath` is set globally: `git config --global --get credential.useHttpPath` should print `true`.
2. Confirm a per-URL entry exists for the org: `git config --global --get-urlmatch credential https://github.com/<org>` should list the username.
3. Re-run with `--verbose`; APM logs `trying git credential fill for <host> (path=<owner>/<repo>)` so you can confirm the path APM is sending matches your config entry.

## Fine-grained PAT setup

Fine-grained PATs (`github_pat_`) are scoped to a **single resource owner** — either a user account or an organization. A user-scoped fine-grained PAT **cannot** access repos owned by an organization, even if you are a member of that org.

To access org packages, create the PAT with the **org** as the resource owner at [github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).

Required permissions:

| Permission | Level | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **Metadata** | Read | Validation and discovery |
| **Contents** | Read | Downloading package files |

Set **Repository access** to "All repositories" or select the specific repos your manifest references.

**Alternatives that skip scoping entirely:**

- `gh auth login` — produces an OAuth token that inherits your full org membership. Easiest zero-config path.
- Classic PATs (`ghp_`) — inherit the user's membership across all orgs. GitHub is deprecating these in favor of fine-grained PATs.

## Enterprise Managed Users (EMU)

EMU orgs can live on **github.com** (e.g., `contoso-microsoft`) or on **GHE Cloud Data Residency** (`*.ghe.com`). EMU tokens are standard PATs (`ghp_` classic or `github_pat_` fine-grained) — there is no special prefix. They are scoped to the enterprise and cannot access public repos on github.com.

Fine-grained PATs for EMU orgs **must** use the EMU org as the resource owner — a user-scoped fine-grained PAT will not work. See [Fine-grained PAT setup](#fine-grained-pat-setup).

If your manifest mixes enterprise and public packages, use separate tokens:

```bash
export GITHUB_APM_PAT_CONTOSO_MICROSOFT=github_pat_enterprise_token  # EMU org
```

Public repos on github.com work without authentication. Set `GITHUB_APM_PAT` only if you need to access private repos or avoid rate limits.

### GHE Cloud Data Residency (`*.ghe.com`)

`*.ghe.com` hosts are always auth-required — there are no public repos. APM skips the unauthenticated attempt entirely for these hosts:

```bash
export GITHUB_APM_PAT_MYENTERPRISE=ghp_enterprise_token
apm install myenterprise.ghe.com/platform/standards
```

## GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)

Set `GITHUB_HOST` to your GHES instance. Bare package names resolve against this host:

```bash
export GITHUB_HOST=github.company.com
export GITHUB_APM_PAT_MYORG=ghp_ghes_token
apm install myorg/internal-package  # → github.company.com/myorg/internal-package
```

Use full hostnames for packages on other hosts:

```yaml
dependencies:
  apm:
    - team/internal-package                   # → GITHUB_HOST
    - github.com/public/open-source-package   # → github.com
```

Setting `GITHUB_HOST` makes bare package names (without explicit host) resolve against your GHES instance. Alternatively, skip env vars and configure `git credential fill` for your GHES host.

## Azure DevOps

The recommended way to authenticate with Azure DevOps is via `az login`:

```bash
az login --tenant <your-tenant-id>
apm install dev.azure.com/myorg/myproject/myrepo
```

Alternatively, set an explicit PAT:

```bash
export ADO_APM_PAT=your_ado_pat
apm install dev.azure.com/myorg/myproject/myrepo
```

ADO is always auth-required. Uses 3-segment paths (`org/project/repo`). Always use FQDN syntax for cloud ADO:

```bash
apm install dev.azure.com/myorg/myproject/myrepo#main
apm install mycompany.visualstudio.com/org/project/repo  # legacy URL

# Sub-path inside an ADO repo, pinned to a tag (use the _git form for sub-paths):
apm install dev.azure.com/myorg/myproject/_git/myrepo/instructions/security#v2.0
```

If your ADO project or repository name contains spaces, URL-encode them as `%20`:

```bash
apm install dev.azure.com/myorg/My%20Project/_git/My%20Repo%20Name
```

Create the PAT at `https://dev.azure.com/{org}/_usersSettings/tokens` with **Code (Read)** permission.

### On-prem Azure DevOps Server

If you have an on-prem Azure DevOps Server (not `dev.azure.com`),
register its hostname so APM routes it through the ADO PAT chain instead of
the generic or GHES chain. No manual host-type flag is needed:

```bash
# Single on-prem host
export ADO_HOST=ado.company.com
export ADO_APM_PAT=your_ado_server_pat
apm install ado.company.com/DefaultCollection/MyProject/_git/MyRepo

# Multiple on-prem hosts
export APM_ADO_HOSTS=ado1.company.com,ado2.company.com
apm install ado1.company.com/DefaultCollection/MyProject/_git/MyRepo

# Explicit port (e.g. IIS with non-standard port)
apm install https://ado.company.com:8080/DefaultCollection/MyProject/_git/MyRepo
```

Both variables accept hostnames only: no scheme, port, or path. Entries are
trimmed, matched case-insensitively, and must be valid FQDNs (bare hostnames
like `localhost` are rejected). Put an explicit HTTPS port in the dependency
URL, as shown above. The first path segment is the Azure DevOps Server
collection; root-hosted collection URLs are supported. A server mounted below
a path prefix such as `/tfs/` is not currently supported.

If `GITHUB_HOST` names the same hostname, `ADO_HOST` or `APM_ADO_HOSTS`
takes precedence and the host is classified as ADO, not GHES. Adding the ADO
configuration is sufficient; `GITHUB_HOST` does not have to be unset.

Azure DevOps Server authentication is PAT-only in APM:

```bash
export ADO_APM_PAT=your_ado_server_pat
```

The Azure CLI bearer fallback described below applies to Azure DevOps
Services (`dev.azure.com` and `*.visualstudio.com`), not Azure DevOps Server.

Create your PAT at `https://{ado-host}/_usersSettings/tokens` with **Code (Read)** permission.

### Authenticating with Microsoft Entra ID (AAD) bearer tokens (Azure DevOps Services)

When your org has disabled PAT creation (managed-identity-only orgs, locked-down enterprise tenants), APM can use an AAD bearer token issued by the Azure CLI instead. This applies to **Azure DevOps Services** (`dev.azure.com`, `*.visualstudio.com`). For on-prem ADO Server, see the note in the section above.

No env var is required: APM picks up the token from your active `az` session on demand.

**Prerequisite:** install the [Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/installazurecli) and sign in against the tenant that owns the org:

```bash
az login --tenant <your-tenant-id>
apm install dev.azure.com/myorg/myproject/myrepo
```

**Finding your tenant ID:** if you are unsure which tenant owns the ADO org, visit `https://dev.azure.com/{org}/_settings/organizationAad` in a browser, or ask your admin. You can also run `az login` without `--tenant` and inspect `az account show --query tenantId -o tsv`.

**Resolution precedence for Azure DevOps Services** (`dev.azure.com` and
`*.visualstudio.com`):

1. `ADO_APM_PAT` env var if set
2. AAD bearer via `az account get-access-token` if `az` is installed and signed in
3. Otherwise: auth-failed error with guidance for both paths

`apm marketplace check` uses this same chain for an ADO `marketplace.sourceBase`.
Azure CLI credentials are passed to `git ls-remote` as a bearer Authorization
header, never embedded in the repository URL. Validation does not invoke native
Git credential helpers for ADO.

**Stale-PAT fallback:** if `ADO_APM_PAT` is set but rejected (HTTP 401), APM silently retries with the `az` bearer and emits:

```
[!] ADO_APM_PAT was rejected for dev.azure.com; fell back to az cli bearer.
[!]     Consider unsetting the stale variable.
```

This fallback applies to all ADO operations, including semver tag enumeration,
marketplace version resolution, and `apm install --update`. If you have a stale
`ADO_APM_PAT` but an active `az login` session, the ref lookup succeeds
transparently via the bearer retry.

If both `ADO_APM_PAT` and the `az` bearer fail, the diagnostic starts with:

```
ADO_APM_PAT was rejected; az cli bearer was also rejected.
```

This confirms both paths were attempted and neither succeeded, so the fix is either to refresh your PAT or run `az login`.

**Verbose output** (`--verbose`) shows which source was used per host:

```
[i] dev.azure.com -- using bearer from az cli (source: AAD_BEARER_AZ_CLI)
[i] dev.azure.com -- token from ADO_APM_PAT
```

Bearer tokens are short-lived (~60 minutes), acquired on demand, never persisted by APM. See [Security Model: Token handling](../../enterprise/security/#token-handling) for the full posture.

### Auth-failure diagnostics

When authentication fails, APM prints a targeted diagnostic instead of a generic "not accessible or doesn't exist" message. The diagnostic tells you exactly which path failed and what to do next. For `--update` operations, APM verifies auth *before* modifying any files -- if the pre-flight check fails, you will see `No files were modified` and your `apm.yml`, `apm.lock.yaml`, and `apm_modules/` directory remain untouched.

## GitLab (SaaS and self-managed)

### Host classification

APM must classify a host as GitLab to use **GitLab REST v4** (for example `marketplace.json` fetches and install-time single-file reads). Configuration mirrors GHES-style host overrides:

| Signal | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `GITLAB_HOST` | Environment variable for one self-managed GitLab FQDN (e.g. `git.company.com`) |
| `APM_GITLAB_HOSTS` | Environment variable for several self-managed GitLab FQDNs, comma-separated |
| `type: gitlab` | Backend/API routing hint for one dependency; does not authorize global GitLab tokens |

`gitlab.com` is detected automatically. For a single dependency on a bespoke
hostname, use object form instead of a hostname convention:

```yaml
- git: https://code.acme.com/platform/standards.git
  type: gitlab
```

For `gitlab.com` and hosts explicitly trusted through `GITLAB_HOST` or `APM_GITLAB_HOSTS`, credentials follow **`GITLAB_APM_PAT` → `GITLAB_TOKEN`** and then **`git credential fill`** (see [GitLab-class hosts](#gitlab-class-hosts-gitlabcom-gitlab_host-apm_gitlab_hosts) under [Token lookup](#token-lookup)). `type: gitlab` selects backend/API routing only; other hinted hosts use host-scoped `git credential fill` or anonymous access and do not receive global GitLab tokens. GitHub PAT env vars are not used on GitLab. Use a GitLab personal or project access token with API read access where your policy requires it.

For GitLab `path:` sparse fetches, APM consults this credential chain only
when the effective Git remote uses HTTPS. SSH, HTTP, and local-mirror
attempts use their native transport policy without PATs or HTTPS credential
helper lookup. Safe Git `insteadOf` rewrites still apply; see the
[GitLab sparse-fetch policy](../../consumer/authentication/#gitlab-saas-or-self-managed).

### REST headers (GitLab vs GitHub)

For GitHub and GHES, APM sends repository API requests with `Authorization: token <PAT>` (or equivalent). For **GitLab REST v4**, PATs are sent with the **`PRIVATE-TOKEN`** header (GitLab’s convention). OAuth-style access tokens can use `Authorization: Bearer` when applicable. APM does not log token values.

## Package source behavior

| Package source | Host | Auth behavior | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bare shorthand | `default_host()` | Host-class-specific chain above | Depends on classified host |
| `github.com/org/repo` | github.com | Global env vars -> `gh auth token` -> credential fill | Unauth for public repos |
| `contoso.ghe.com/org/repo` | *.ghe.com | Global env vars -> `gh auth token` -> credential fill | Auth-only (no public repos) |
| GHES via `GITHUB_HOST` | ghes.company.com | Global env vars -> `gh auth token` -> credential fill | Unauth for public repos |
| GitLab (`gitlab.com` or host listed in `GITLAB_HOST` / `APM_GITLAB_HOSTS`) | gitlab.com or self-managed | HTTPS/API: `GITLAB_APM_PAT` -> `GITLAB_TOKEN` -> credential helper; REST uses `PRIVATE-TOKEN`; SSH uses native SSH auth; GitHub env vars excluded | Sparse-fetch REST requires exhausted same-origin effective HTTPS; otherwise native transport access |
| `dev.azure.com/org/proj/repo` | ADO (cloud) | `ADO_APM_PAT` -> AAD bearer via `az` | Auth-only |
| ADO Server via `ADO_HOST` / `APM_ADO_HOSTS` | on-prem ADO | `ADO_APM_PAT` only | Auth-only |
| Artifactory registry proxy | custom FQDN | `PROXY_REGISTRY_TOKEN` | Error if `PROXY_REGISTRY_ONLY=1` |

## Registry proxy (Artifactory)

Air-gapped environments route all VCS traffic through a JFrog Artifactory proxy. APM supports this via three env vars:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `PROXY_REGISTRY_URL` | Full proxy base URL, e.g. `https://art.example.com/artifactory/github` |
| `PROXY_REGISTRY_TOKEN` | Bearer token for the proxy |
| `PROXY_REGISTRY_ONLY` | Set to `1` to block all direct VCS access -- only proxy downloads allowed |

```bash
export PROXY_REGISTRY_URL=https://art.example.com/artifactory/github
export PROXY_REGISTRY_TOKEN=your_bearer_token
export PROXY_REGISTRY_ONLY=1    # optional -- enforces proxy-only mode

apm install
```

When `PROXY_REGISTRY_URL` is set, APM rewrites download URLs to go through the proxy and sends `PROXY_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as the `Authorization: Bearer` header instead of the GitHub PAT.

### Lockfile and reproducibility

After a successful proxy install, `apm.lock.yaml` records the proxy host and path prefix as separate fields:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - repo_url: owner/repo
    host: art.example.com        # pure FQDN -- no path
    registry_prefix: artifactory/github  # path prefix
    resolved_commit: abc123def456
```

Subsequent `apm install` runs (without `--update`) read these fields to reconstruct the proxy URL and route auth to `PROXY_REGISTRY_TOKEN`, ensuring byte-for-byte reproducibility without needing the original env vars to be set identically.

### Proxy-only enforcement

With `PROXY_REGISTRY_ONLY=1`, APM will:

1. Validate the existing `apm.lock.yaml` at startup and exit with an error if any entry is locked to a direct VCS source (no `registry_prefix`)
2. Skip the download cache for entries that have no `registry_prefix` (forcing a fresh proxy download)
3. Raise an error for any package reference that does not route through the configured proxy

### Deprecated Artifactory env vars

The following env vars still work but emit a `DeprecationWarning`. Migrate to the `PROXY_REGISTRY_*` equivalents:

| Deprecated | Replacement |
|------------|-------------|
| `ARTIFACTORY_BASE_URL` | `PROXY_REGISTRY_URL` |
| `ARTIFACTORY_APM_TOKEN` | `PROXY_REGISTRY_TOKEN` |
| `ARTIFACTORY_ONLY` | `PROXY_REGISTRY_ONLY` |

## Registry tokens

Dedicated APM registries (declared in `apm.yml`, `~/.apm/config.json`, or both) use a dedicated env-var prefix that is **distinct** from `GITHUB_APM_PAT_*`, `PROXY_REGISTRY_*`, and `ARTIFACTORY_APM_TOKEN` — there is no collision with Git auth.

Package registries are experimental. Run `apm experimental enable registries` before using these tokens with registry-sourced dependencies.

| Env var | Auth method |
|---|---|
| `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_{NAME}` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |
| `APM_REGISTRY_USER_{NAME}` + `APM_REGISTRY_PASS_{NAME}` | `Authorization: Basic <base64(user:pass)>` |

`{NAME}` is the registry name, uppercased, with `-` and `.` mapped to `_` (e.g. `jf-skills` -> `JF_SKILLS`). When both forms are set, Bearer wins. When neither is set, APM tries the request anonymously and surfaces a remediation message on `401`/`403`.

:::caution[Silent auth failures]
A misspelled env var is indistinguishable from a missing token — APM attempts anonymous access and only reports auth failure from the server. Names `corp-main` and `corp.main` map to the same `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_CORP_MAIN`; do not register both. See [Registries guide — pitfalls](../../guides/registries/#pitfalls).
:::

Token precedence (highest wins): `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_{NAME}` env var → `registry.<name>.token` in `~/.apm/config.json`.

APM sends either credential only when `registry.<name>.url` in `~/.apm/config.json` matches the request destination. Configure that user-owned URL even when the project also declares the registry. Project-only registry declarations remain anonymous, and credentials are never sent over HTTP.

```bash
apm config set registry.jf-skills.url https://registry.example.com
export APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_JF_SKILLS=eyJ...
# or persist locally:
apm config set registry.jf-skills.token eyJ...
apm install
```

For the full registry workflow — declaring registries, scoping dependencies, and lockfile semantics — see the [Registries guide](../../guides/registries/).

## Troubleshooting

### Rate limits on github.com

APM tries unauthenticated access first for public repos to conserve rate limits during validation (e.g., checking if a repo exists). For downloads, authenticated requests are preferred — with unauthenticated fallback for public repos on github.com. If you hit rate limits, set any token:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_any_valid_token
```

### SSO-protected organizations

Authorize your PAT for SSO at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) — click **Configure SSO** next to the token.

### EMU token can't access public repos

EMU PATs use standard prefixes (`ghp_`, `github_pat_`) — there is no EMU-specific prefix. They are enterprise-scoped and cannot access public github.com repos. Use a standard PAT for public repos alongside your EMU PAT — see [Enterprise Managed Users (EMU)](#enterprise-managed-users-emu) above.

### Fine-grained PAT can't access org repos

Fine-grained PATs are scoped to one resource owner. If you created the PAT under your **user account**, it cannot access repos owned by an organization — even if you are an org member. Recreate the PAT with the **org** as the resource owner. Classic PATs (`ghp_`) and `gh auth login` OAuth tokens do not have this limitation. See [Fine-grained PAT setup](#fine-grained-pat-setup).

### Diagnosing auth failures

Run with `--verbose` to see the full resolution chain:

```bash
apm install --verbose your-org/package
```

The output shows which env var matched (or `none`), the detected token type (`fine-grained`, `classic`, `oauth`, `github-app`), and the host classification (`github`, `ghe_cloud`, `ghes`, `ado`, `gitlab`, `generic`).

### Git credential helper not found

APM calls `git credential fill` as a fallback (60s timeout). If your credential helper needs more time (e.g., Windows account picker), set `APM_GIT_CREDENTIAL_TIMEOUT` (seconds, max 180):

```bash
export APM_GIT_CREDENTIAL_TIMEOUT=120
```

Ensure a credential helper is configured:

```bash
git config credential.helper              # check current helper
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain  # macOS
gh auth login                              # GitHub CLI
```

#### Custom-port hosts and per-port credentials

For self-hosted Git instances on non-standard ports (e.g. Bitbucket Datacenter on port 7999), APM sends `host=<host>:<port>` to `git credential fill` per the [`gitcredentials(7)`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials) protocol. Whether distinct credentials are returned for different ports depends on the helper:

| Helper | Honors port-in-host? |
|---|---|
| git-credential-manager (GCM) | Yes |
| macOS Keychain (`osxkeychain`) | Yes (stores full `host:port` as key) |
| `libsecret` (Linux) | Yes (port in URI) |
| `gh auth git-credential` | No -- but only used for GitHub hosts, which do not use custom ports |

If APM resolves the wrong credential for a custom-port host, confirm your helper keys by `host:port` using the helper-agnostic verification command:

```sh
printf 'protocol=https\nhost=<host>:<port>\n\n' | git credential fill
```

This reproduces exactly what APM sends to the credential helper. If the returned `username`/`password` are wrong or empty, either switch helpers or store credentials under a fully qualified `https://<host>:<port>/` URL.

### SSH connection hangs on corporate/VPN networks

When APM clones over SSH (because the dependency is an SSH URL, the user
passed `--ssh`, `git config url.<base>.insteadOf` rewrites to SSH, or
`--allow-protocol-fallback` is in effect), firewalls that silently drop SSH
packets (port 22) can make `apm install` appear to hang. APM forces
`BatchMode=yes`, disables askpass and HTTP credential channels, and sets a
30-second connection timeout so SSH attempts fail without prompting.

If you already set `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` (e.g., for a custom key), APM appends
`-o BatchMode=yes` and appends `-o ConnectTimeout=30` unless
`ConnectTimeout` is already present in your value.

If SSH is unreachable from your network, force HTTPS:

```bash
apm install --https
export APM_GIT_PROTOCOL=https
```

To persist the HTTPS preference across all future installs without re-exporting the variable:

```bash
apm config set prefer-ssh false   # explicit: never prefer SSH for shorthand deps
# or, if you want APM to always try HTTPS for shorthand deps:
# export APM_GIT_PROTOCOL=https   # process-scoped; add to shell profile for persistence
```

See [apm config](../../reference/cli/config/) for the full transport-preference config surface.

## Choosing transport (SSH vs HTTPS)

Authentication and transport are independent decisions:

- **HTTPS** uses the token resolution chain documented above. APM resolves a
  token per `(host, port, org)` and sends managed GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps
  credentials through a process-scoped Authorization header, never URL userinfo.
- **SSH** uses your existing ssh-agent and `~/.ssh/config`. APM does not
  select keys or override agent behavior -- whatever `git clone` would do
  on the same machine, APM does.

APM picks one initial transport per dependency and uses it for clone/fetch and
semver tag discovery. When `prefer-ssh` selects SSH, strict mode does not
silently probe HTTPS. An explicit URL scheme prevents APM from selecting another
protocol, while Git still applies matching safe `url.<base>.insteadOf` rules
afterward. Shorthand defaults to HTTPS unless a flag or configuration selects
SSH. For the full matrix and fallback escape hatch, see [Manage dependencies:
Transport selection](../../consumer/manage-dependencies/#transport-selection).

:::caution[Custom ports and cross-protocol fallback]
When `--allow-protocol-fallback` is in effect, APM reuses the
dependency URL's port on both SSH and HTTPS attempts. On servers that
use different ports per protocol (e.g. Bitbucket Datacenter: SSH 7999,
HTTPS 7990), the off-protocol URL will be wrong. APM emits a `[!]`
warning before the first clone attempt to flag this. To avoid
cross-protocol retries, leave `--allow-protocol-fallback` disabled
(strict mode) and pin the dependency with an explicit `ssh://...` or
`https://...` URL. If the flag is enabled, APM may still try the
other protocol even when the URL uses an explicit scheme.
