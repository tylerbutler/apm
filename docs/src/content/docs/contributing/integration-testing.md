  order: 3

This document describes APM's integration testing strategy to ensure runtime setup scripts work correctly and the golden scenario from the README functions as expected.

## Testing Strategy

APM uses a tiered approach to integration testing:

### 1. **Smoke Tests** (merge queue, runtime changes, and releases)
- **Location**: `tests/integration/test_runtime_smoke.py`
- **Purpose**: Fast verification that runtime setup scripts work
- **Scope**: 
  - Runtime installation (codex, llm)
  - Binary functionality (`--version`, `--help`)
  - APM runtime detection
  - Workflow compilation without execution
- **Duration**: ~2-3 minutes per platform
- **Trigger**: merge queue integration workflow, runtime-code pushes, scheduled/manual runs, and release validation

### 2. **End-to-End Golden Scenario Tests** (merge queue and promotion runs)
- **Location**: `tests/integration/test_golden_scenario_e2e.py`
- **Purpose**: Complete verification of the README golden scenario
- **Scope**:
  - Full runtime setup and configuration
  - Project initialization (`apm init`)
  - Dependency installation (`apm install`)
  - Real API calls to GitHub Models
  - Copilot, Codex, LLM, and Gemini runtime execution
- **Duration**: ~10-15 minutes per platform (with 20-minute timeout)  
- **Trigger**: merge queue integration workflow, plus tag, schedule, and manual promotion runs

### 3. **Lifecycle Smoke** (PR-time required check)
- **Location**: selected declaratively via `lifecycle_smoke and not lifecycle_merge_group`. Tests marked `lifecycle_merge_group` remain outside the bounded required set.
- **Purpose**: Promote a stable, hermetic slice of Consume/Produce/Govern lifecycle contracts onto the PR-time critical path, so regressions in install, lock, deployment ownership, compile, pack, prune, uninstall, audit, and repair fail the PR.
- **Scope**: the family contains a static authority guard plus content-hash, policy, hook, virtual-package, audit, auth, and installed-console rows. Real subprocess cases use the uv-installed `apm` command and local Git. This is not frozen PyInstaller coverage.
- **Prerequisites**: the pytest step sets `APM_E2E_TESTS=1` so subprocess rows execute. `APM_RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS` remains unset, the socket guard denies network sockets, and the job binds no credentials.
- **Duration**: the required expression must remain inside its hard 6-minute job timeout; hosted duration is authoritative.
- **Trigger**: every pull request and merge queue run (`ci.yml`'s `lifecycle-smoke` job, required via `merge-gate.yml`)
- **Selection mechanism**: `pytest --strict-markers -m 'lifecycle_smoke and not lifecycle_merge_group' tests/integration` -- declarative, not a file/node-id list. No central count or membership list is maintained.
- **Full-coverage path**: merge-group workflow `ci-integration.yml`, job `integration-tests-shard`, step `Run integration tests (sharded + parallelized)`, calls `uv run ./scripts/test-integration.sh`; that script runs unfiltered `pytest tests/integration/`, so the complete lifecycle family remains exercised.
- **Drift guard**: `tests/quality/test_ci_topology.py` independently collects the full, merge-group-only, and required selections; verifies their set partition; and preserves the required expression, full-integration execution path, step-level `APM_E2E_TESTS: "1"` binding, network/credential prohibitions, and required-check membership.
- **Fixture controls**: lifecycle helpers set `APM_TEST_LOOPBACK_PORTS` for a port-scoped local registry and `APM_TEST_FAIL_LOCK_REPLACE=1` for atomic-write fault injection. These are internal test controls, not user-facing APM settings.
- **Learning ledger**: `tests/fixtures/lifecycle_bug_ledger.json` maps representative escaped defects to generalized laws, oracle tiers, phases, and executable regression node IDs, including coverage of already-correct behavior. Use same-workspace transitions to prove survivor ownership and scoped cleanup. It is not a bug-count census; `tests/quality/test_lifecycle_bug_ledger.py` validates its taxonomy and links.
- **Generated lifecycle model**: `test_generated_lifecycle_state_machine.py` uses Hypothesis to generate guarded install, dry-run, audit, tamper, repair, declaration, and prune sequences against the real CLI. The model tracks declaration, materialization, integrity, and lock state independently of the product lockfile. Every transition captures complete project and user roots, and mutating commands must stay inside reviewed write sets. It stays in the merge-group family until hosted runtime supports promotion to the bounded PR-time smoke set.
- **Known gap**: a late lockfile replacement failure can leave target files on the newly declared target while retaining the prior lockfile. The required lifecycle suite bounds that blast radius and proves the next install converges; expanding the install transaction is a separate design decision recorded in the ledger.
- **Run it locally** (the exact command CI runs):
  ```bash
  APM_E2E_TESTS=1 uv run --extra dev pytest -p no:cacheprovider -q --strict-markers \
    -m 'lifecycle_smoke and not lifecycle_merge_group' tests/integration
  ```

### 4. **Live Guardrailing Hero** (scheduled/manual)
- **Location**: `tests/integration/test_guardrailing_hero_e2e.py`
- **Purpose**: Preserve the real remote, token-gated packaged CLI hero without multiplying it across the default packaged platform matrix
- **Scope**: project initialization, two GitHub-backed installs, compile/deploy, and prompt startup through the built Linux x64 binary
- **Trigger**: one `ci-runtime.yml` invocation on schedule or manual dispatch that fails the workflow on error (`continue-on-error` is not set); never pull requests or the generic integration script
- **Selection mechanism**: the explicit test node with `-m live`; collection gates remain owned by `tests/integration/conftest.py`

## Running Tests Locally

Integration tests live under `tests/integration/` and run via `pytest`
directly. Each test module declares the preconditions it needs as
standard pytest markers; the registry in
`tests/integration/conftest.py` (`_MARKER_CHECKS`) automatically skips
tests whose precondition is not met, so you only have to install/set
what the test family you want actually requires.

### The marker registry

| Marker | Precondition | How to satisfy it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requires_e2e_mode` | Opt-in for the heavyweight golden-scenario suite | `export APM_E2E_TESTS=1` |
| `requires_network_integration` | Opt-in for tests that hit live registries | `export APM_RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1` |
| `requires_windows` | A Windows-only process or filesystem boundary | Run on Windows |
| `requires_inference` | Opt-in for tests that call inference APIs | `export APM_RUN_INFERENCE_TESTS=1` |
| `requires_github_token` | A token usable against `github.com` / GitHub Models | `export GITHUB_APM_PAT=...` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN`) |
| `requires_ado_pat` | Azure DevOps PAT for ADO host tests | `export ADO_APM_PAT=...` |
| `requires_ado_bearer` | Azure CLI signed in + opt-in flag | `az login` and `export APM_TEST_ADO_BEARER=1` |
| `requires_apm_binary` | A built `apm` binary on disk or `PATH` | `scripts/build-binary.sh` (or set `APM_BINARY_PATH`) |
| `requires_runtime_codex` | The `codex` runtime installed under `~/.apm/runtimes/` | `apm runtime setup codex` |
| `requires_runtime_copilot` | The GitHub Copilot CLI runtime installed under `~/.apm/runtimes/` | `apm runtime setup copilot` |
| `requires_runtime_llm` | The `llm` runtime installed under `~/.apm/runtimes/` | `apm runtime setup llm` |
| `live` | Tests that hit real third-party repositories; deselected by default | Override the deselect: `pytest -m live tests/integration -v` |

Without any of those env vars or runtimes a `pytest tests/integration`
invocation is silent rather than red: every test is collected and
reported as `SKIPPED` with a one-line reason, so you can see exactly
what is missing and why.

### Three marker axes

Pytest markers compose across independent axes:

| Axis | Question | Markers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Behavioral | What boundary does the test cross? | `unit`, `component`, `e2e` |
| Scheduling | When is the test selected? | `integration`, `slow`, `benchmark`, `live` |
| Prerequisite | What environment must exist? | `requires_*` |
| CI-selection | Is this test part of a named required CI gate? | `lifecycle_smoke` |

`live` is both an opt-in scheduling marker and an external-service
prerequisite. Behavioral markers do not replace prerequisite markers.
`lifecycle_smoke` is orthogonal to all three: it does not describe a
test's boundary, scheduling, or precondition, only that
`ci.yml`'s required `lifecycle-smoke` job selects it via
`-m lifecycle_smoke` (see Tier 3 above for the full rationale).

### Performance selections

Performance checks use three separate selections:

| Selection | Mechanism | Merge effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scaling guards | `tests/benchmarks/test_scaling_guards.py` runs in the normal suite without the `benchmark` marker | Hard merge-time gate |
| Hermetic source-CLI matrix | The benchmark harness selects PR smoke or scheduled/manual full profiles | Command, correctness, and harness failures fail; timing regressions are advisory |
| Live source-CLI matrix | The harness selects a separate live GitHub profile | Non-gating performance evidence |

The `benchmark` marker selects existing pytest microbenchmarks that are
deselected by default. It does not select the source-CLI matrix. The matrix
profiles belong to the
[performance benchmark harness](../performance-benchmarks/), not to the pytest
marker registry.

Do not mark scaling guards as `benchmark`: they must continue to run as hard
performance gates. Do not compare live GitHub observations with the hermetic
baseline. The latest compatible, successful scheduled/manual full artifact
from `main` is the source-CLI timing baseline. Smoke and full always run when
selected, even if no compatible baseline exists. The linked benchmark page
defines the profile rows, sample counts, report validation, and artifact flow.

Existing pytest scenarios marked `live` are also observational tests of
external services. Select them with `-m live`; they are not benchmark-matrix
rows.

The behavioral definitions are:

| Marker | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `unit` | Pure logic with no filesystem and no CLI |
| `component` | In-process behavior that touches a filesystem or one command boundary |
| `e2e` | A real installed CLI crossing at least one command boundary |

`pyproject.toml` owns these definitions.
Module-level `pytestmark` is the sole behavioral classification authority.
This is a marker-only behavioral taxonomy.
Every classified module declares exactly one behavioral marker, and every
collected node in that module must inherit the same classification. Function-
or class-level behavioral markers are rejected because they would split the
module's authority.

There is no central module whitelist or exact classified-module count. New
modules opt in by adding one module-level marker. The trade-off is deliberate:
APM gives up the old closed-set/count ratchet in exchange for distributed
ownership and removal of a central merge hotspot. Repository-wide collection
still rejects empty, mixed, and multiple classifications deterministically.

Directory names and `_e2e.py` suffixes are not proof of behavior.
`test_policy_pinned_constraint_e2e.py` is `component` because it uses Click
in-process; `test_core_smoke.py` is `e2e` because it invokes an installed
binary through subprocess boundaries.

To classify a module:

1. Confirm the whole module has one behavioral boundary.
2. Add exactly one module-level behavioral `pytestmark`, preserving scheduling and
   prerequisite markers.
3. Document why behavior wins if the filename suggests another boundary.
4. Run the contracts:

```bash
uv run --extra dev pytest -p no:cacheprovider -q tests/quality
uv run --frozen python scripts/check_test_assertions.py
uv run --frozen python scripts/check_exact_test_duplicates.py
```

The assertion and exact-duplicate baseline updaters only accept reductions.

```bash
uv run --frozen python scripts/check_test_assertions.py --update-baseline
uv run --frozen python scripts/check_exact_test_duplicates.py --update-baseline
```

Provisional mode is CI-only and allowed only on draft pull requests.
Contributor commands, ready pull requests, merge queue runs, and final
validation are strict. Do not pass the internal provisional flag manually;
remove `provisional` metadata after remeasurement and review.

### Common invocations

```bash
# Run everything you currently have the prerequisites for
uv run pytest tests/integration -v

# Run a single suite (the marker registry still applies)
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_golden_scenario_e2e.py -v

# Run only a marker family
uv run pytest tests/integration -m requires_github_token -v

# Run the bounded generated lifecycle model with a real local apm command
APM_E2E_TESTS=1 APM_BINARY_PATH="$(command -v apm)" \
  uv run --extra dev pytest -q \
  tests/integration/test_generated_lifecycle_state_machine.py
```

### Hermetic lifecycle fixtures

`tests/integration/test_hermetic_lifecycle_foundation.py` is the cross-module
contract. Complete the [development setup](../development-guide/) first.

| Utility | Owns | Contract test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `isolated_apm_environment.py` | Child roots, environment, Python socket tripwire | `test_isolated_apm_environment_contract.py` |
| `local_git_repository.py` | Deterministic local Git origins | `test_local_git_repository_factory_contract.py` |
| `local_package.py` | Source-only package inputs | `test_local_package_factory_contract.py` |
| `apm_lifecycle_runner.py` | Bounded process execution and evidence | `test_apm_lifecycle_runner_contract.py` |
| `lifecycle_state.py` | Exact bytes and semantic durable-state receipts | `test_lifecycle_state_snapshot_contract.py` |
| `artifact_snapshot.py` | Read-only filesystem observations | `test_artifact_snapshot_contract.py` |
| `scenario_rows.py` | Immutable scenario data | `test_scenario_rows_contract.py` |

Source fixtures author only source inputs; the real APM CLI creates lockfiles,
deployed trees, compiled output, bundles, hashes, cache state, and audit
reports.

Use `ArtifactSnapshot` for one complete filesystem root and
`ArtifactSnapshotSet` when an operation can affect multiple isolated roots.
These open-world captures complement `LifecycleStateSnapshot`: the latter
explains semantic lock and deployment state, while the former catches stray
files even when the lockfile fails to record them.

Hypothesis failures print a minimized transition program that can be replayed
by running the failing test with the reported example. Keep the generated model
bounded and deterministic in CI (`database=None`, `derandomize=True`), and turn
every confirmed product defect into a named regression before extending the
ledger. The static scenario rows remain valuable for exact reproductions; the
generated model searches valid orderings that authored rows may miss.

`IsolatedApmEnvironment` builds deterministic child environments for
APM/Git/GitHub/ADO/GitLab/SSH flows with a best-effort Python socket guard.
The guard preserves native optional socket API availability: it defines
`sendmsg` only when the native socket supports it, keeping feature detection
platform-correct. It isolates APM, Git, GH, Azure, home, cache, and temporary
roots, not arbitrary variables; it is not a general credential scrubber.

For deeply nested fixtures that populate real sparse Git caches, use short
pytest-owned roots such as `tmp_path_factory.mktemp("r")` instead of
test-named `tmp_path` roots to avoid Git for Windows metadata path limits.
Retain worker-equivalent directory depth in focused gates so they still
exercise the paths used by the sharded suite.

It is also not an OS/native-code sandbox: executables found through `PATH`
remain trusted, reflective access to CPython internals or native extensions can
bypass Python monkey-patches, `file://` access is not confined by the OS, and
hostile post-creation filesystem races are outside the contract.
`GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=file` and local `url.*.insteadOf` rewriting separately
restrict Git transport in reviewed scenarios.

Keep modules flat. Inside a pytest test with `tmp_path` and
`apm_binary_path`, compose them directly:

```python
import os

from tests.utils.apm_lifecycle_runner import ApmLifecycleRunner
from tests.utils.artifact_snapshot import ArtifactSnapshot
from tests.utils.isolated_apm_environment import IsolatedApmEnvironment
from tests.utils.local_package import LocalPackageFactory

isolated = IsolatedApmEnvironment.create(tmp_path / "scenario", base_env=os.environ)
environment = isolated.subprocess_env()
sources = LocalPackageFactory(isolated.package_root)
project = sources.create("consumer", targets=("copilot",))
sources.add_skill(
    project,
    "example",
    "---\nname: example\ndescription: Fixture\n---\n# Example\n",
)
result = ApmLifecycleRunner((str(apm_binary_path),)).run(
    ("install", "--target", "copilot"),
    cwd=project.root,
    env=environment,
)
snapshot = ArtifactSnapshot.capture(project.root)
assert result.returncode == 0
assert "apm.lock.yaml" in snapshot.paths
```

For auth-bearing remote-package scenarios, create a local origin with
`LocalGitRepositoryFactory` and pass the complete environment returned by
`url_rewrite_subprocess_env()` to `ApmLifecycleRunner`. That process-scoped Git
rewrite survives the production auth environment builder; do not hand-merge
`GIT_CONFIG_*` slots or rely on the older global-config-only rewrite.
`ApmLifecycleRunner((str(apm_binary_path),))` invokes the fixture-selected
console script. Packaged-binary tests belong to the separate platform lane.

`test_packaged_virtual_file_lifecycle_e2e.py`,
`test_deployed_files_e2e.py`, and
`test_silent_adopt_existing_files_e2e.py` are narrow hermetic packaged
counterparts to the live hero. They run the real binary against a local bare
Git origin through process-scoped URL rewriting, then check package
installation, deployment lifecycle, and exact lock provenance without
credentials or live HTTP.

```bash
# The three hermetic packaged counterparts (real binary, local file:// origin, no creds):
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_packaged_virtual_file_lifecycle_e2e.py -v
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_deployed_files_e2e.py -v
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_silent_adopt_existing_files_e2e.py -v

# Supporting hermetic foundation + contract suites:
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_local_package_factory_contract.py -v
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_hermetic_lifecycle_foundation.py -v
uv run pytest -n auto tests/integration/test_hermetic_lifecycle_foundation.py -v
```

These suites need no PAT and make no live HTTP calls: the packaged binary reaches
the dependency through a process-scoped `file://` URL rewrite. If one fails with a
network or authentication error, the rewrite did not apply -- confirm the test uses
the `hermetic_packaged_sample` fixture (which sets `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` and
`GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=file`) rather than invoking `apm` against the raw GitHub URL.

### Apm binary resolution

Tests that need to shell out to a real `apm` binary use the
`apm_binary_path` fixture and the `requires_apm_binary` marker. The
binary is resolved in this order, so a local build is preferred over a
system install:

1. `APM_BINARY_PATH` env var
2. `./dist/apm-<os>-<arch>/apm` (the layout produced by `scripts/build-binary.sh`)
3. `shutil.which("apm")`

`apm_engine_command` is the canonical fixture for narrowly scoped Python
filesystem-boundary fault injection: it returns `(sys.executable, "-m",
"apm_cli.cli")` so `ApmLifecycleRunner` executes the installed Python engine.
This is an explicit engine contract, not packaged-binary coverage, and it is
independent of `APM_BINARY_PATH` so frozen CI cannot bypass the instrumentation.
Packaged executable tests must continue to use `apm_binary_path`.

### Adding an integration test that needs a precondition

1. Apply the marker at module or test level:
   ```python
   import pytest
   pytestmark = pytest.mark.requires_github_token
   ```
2. If you need a brand-new precondition, add an entry to
   `_MARKER_CHECKS` in `tests/integration/conftest.py` (predicate +
   skip reason) and declare the marker in `pyproject.toml`. That is
   the only place the precondition needs to live.

### CI orchestrator: `scripts/test-integration.sh`

`scripts/test-integration.sh` is the thin orchestrator the CI
integration job invokes. Its sole responsibilities are: resolve
GitHub / ADO tokens, detect platform, locate or build the apm
PyInstaller binary, install runtimes (codex / copilot / llm),
install python test dependencies, and run
`pytest tests/integration/` once. All per-test gating lives in the
marker registry described above. New integration tests dropped into
`tests/integration/` are picked up automatically; add the right
`requires_*` marker and the registry will skip the test when its
precondition is missing.

Release promotion sets `PYTEST_MARK_EXPR="not live"`, so an expiring
third-party credential cannot block publication. Live ADO PAT coverage is
owned by the **Auth Acceptance Tests** workflow: dispatch it with
`ado_pat_e2e: true` and an `ado_repo` acceptance fixture. That workflow
selects `live and requires_ado_pat`, requires
`AUTH_TEST_ADO_APM_PAT`, and fails with the normal actionable auth
diagnostic when the PAT is rejected.

Run the same focused acceptance locally with:

```bash
APM_TEST_ADO_REPO=dev.azure.com/org/project/_git/repo \
ADO_APM_PAT=... \
uv run pytest tests/integration/ -m "live and requires_ado_pat" -v
```

The orchestrator is mainly intended for reproducing the full CI
environment end-to-end; for local iteration prefer the direct
`pytest` invocations earlier on this page.

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**On PR and merge queue:**
1. PR-time unit checks and the hermetic Lifecycle Smoke gate run first; merge queue adds Linux smoke, integration, and release-validation gates.

The required Windows compatibility gate selects `windows_compat` tests. Its collection guard requires a non-empty subset, not a fixed test count, so adding marked regressions does not require raising a ceiling. The workflow's test roots and timeout bound scope and runtime.

Linux Lifecycle Smoke runs the required marker subset with `-n 2 --dist loadgroup`. Grouped tests stay on one worker, and the six-minute job limit remains unchanged.

**On pushed version tag releases:**
1. Unit tests + Smoke tests
2. Build binaries (cross-platform)
3. **E2E golden scenario tests** (using built binaries). Linux and macOS Apple Silicon retain the full non-live integration corpus; macOS Intel runs the marker-bounded `lifecycle_smoke and not live` subset plus native startup and isolated release validation.
4. Create GitHub Release
5. Publish to PyPI 

**Daily scheduled release smoke:**
- Runs the same promotion validation path once per day.
- If a build matrix leg fails, downstream Linux/Windows integration and release-validation jobs still run for any platform artifact that was produced.
- Failing scheduled runs update one `ci/daily-smoke` tracking issue; a later recovered run closes it.
- This signal is advisory and is not a required PR check.

**Manual workflow dispatch:**
- Test builds (uploads as workflow artifacts)
- Allows testing the full build pipeline without creating a release, even when dispatched from a tag ref
- Useful for validating changes before tagging

### Windows unit hang diagnostics

The Windows full-unit step in `.github/workflows/build-release.yml` runs:

```sh
uv run pytest tests/unit tests/test_console.py -n auto --dist worksteal -vv --tb=short --show-capture=no --no-showlocals
```

`PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` keeps named test starts and outcomes visible while the suite runs. Captured test output and local-variable dumps remain disabled. These diagnostics identify candidate unfinished tests, not stack frames or the exact blocked phase; an outcome can appear before fixture teardown completes.

The 60-minute step limit fails closed on a hang; it is not proof that tests pass or a root-cause fix. Test selection and parallelism are unchanged. The PR-time `windows_compat` gate exercises live name visibility during setup, call, and teardown after a failed call.

### GitHub Actions Authentication

E2E tests require proper GitHub Models API access:

**Required Permissions:**
- `contents: read` - for repository access
- `models: read` - **Required for GitHub Models API access**

**Environment Variables:**
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - user-scoped token for GitHub Models runtime calls
- `GITHUB_APM_PAT` - package access token; used as fallback by runtime setup

Runtime setup prefers `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GitHub Models and falls back to `GITHUB_APM_PAT` when no user-scoped token is present.

### Release Pipeline Sequencing

The workflow ensures quality gates at each step:

1. **build-and-test** jobs - Unit tests plus binary builds
2. **integration-tests** job - Comprehensive non-live runtime scenarios
3. **release-validation** job - Final shipped-binary validation
4. **create-release** job - GitHub release creation
5. **publish-pypi** job - PyPI package publication

Each publication stage must succeed before proceeding to the next. Live
third-party credential acceptance remains a failing gate in the opt-in Auth
Acceptance workflow rather than a dependency of release publication.

The [`microsoft/homebrew-apm`](https://github.com/microsoft/homebrew-apm) tap updates independently: it polls the latest APM release and commits formula updates with its own repository-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The release pipeline does not hold a cross-repository Homebrew credential.

### Test Matrix

Promotion integration tests run on:
- **Linux**: ubuntu-24.04 (x86_64), ubuntu-24.04-arm (arm64)
- **Windows**: windows-latest (x86_64)
- **macOS Intel**: macos-15-intel (x86_64), with marker-bounded `lifecycle_smoke and not live` integration coverage, native binary startup, and isolated release validation
- **macOS Apple Silicon**: macos-latest (arm64), with the full non-live integration corpus

**Python Version**: 3.12 (standardized across all environments)
**Package Manager**: uv (for fast dependency management and virtual environments)

## What the Tests Verify

### Smoke Tests Verify:
- [+] Runtime setup scripts execute successfully
- [+] Binaries are downloaded and installed correctly
- [+] Binaries respond to basic commands
- [+] APM can detect installed runtimes
- [+] Configuration files are created properly
- [+] Workflow compilation works (without execution)

### E2E Tests Verify:
- [+] Complete golden scenario from README works
- [+] `apm runtime setup copilot` installs and configures GitHub Copilot CLI
- [+] `apm runtime setup codex` installs and configures Codex
- [+] `apm runtime setup llm` installs and configures LLM
- [+] `apm init my-hello-world` creates project correctly
- [+] `apm install` handles dependencies
- [+] `apm run start --param name="Tester"` executes successfully
- [+] Real API calls to GitHub Models work
- [+] Parameter substitution works correctly
- [+] MCP integration functions (GitHub tools)
- [+] Binary artifacts work across platforms
- [+] Release pipeline integrity (GitHub Release -> PyPI)

### Lifecycle Smoke Verifies:
- Install content-hash roundtrip (Consume contract)
- Virtual-skill lock convergence (Produce contract, adjacent to the #2226 ADO lock-coordinate fix)
- Policy pinned-constraint enforcement (Govern contract)
- The virtual/manifestless lifecycle matrix: install, lock, frozen-install, update, and audit stay consistent (the direct #2240 regression)
- The ADO lock-coordinate single-owner guard (the direct #2226 regression)
- Prune's merged-hook and ownership-sidecar reconciliation for the `claude` target (the direct #2249 regression -- an orphaned package's merged hook entries and sidecar markers must be cleaned up, not left pointing at deleted scripts)
- No network, no credentials, no built binary required for any of the above

## Benefits

### **Speed vs Confidence Balance**
- **Smoke tests**: Fast feedback (2-3 min) on every change
- **E2E tests**: High confidence (15 min) only when shipping

### **Cost Efficiency**
- Smoke tests use no API credits
- E2E tests only run on releases (minimizing API usage)
- Manual workflow dispatch for test builds without publishing

### **Platform Coverage**
- Tests run on all supported platforms
- Catches platform-specific runtime issues

### **Release Confidence**
- E2E tests must pass before any publishing steps
- Multi-stage release pipeline ensures quality gates
- Guarantees shipped releases work end-to-end
- Users can trust the README golden scenario
- Cross-platform binary verification

## Debugging Test Failures

### Smoke Test Failures
- Check runtime setup script output
- Verify platform compatibility
- Check network connectivity for downloads

### E2E Test Failures  
- **Use the unified integration script first**: Run `./scripts/test-integration.sh` to reproduce the exact CI environment locally
- Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` has required permissions (`models:read`)
- Ensure both `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_MODELS_KEY` environment variables are set
- Check GitHub Models API availability
- Review actual vs expected output
- Test locally with same environment

### Lifecycle Smoke Failures
- These tests are hermetic -- no credentials, no built binary, no network (a real socket attempt raises `OSError`, it does not hang or retry). A failure is a genuine regression, not an environment issue.
- Run the exact CI command from the "Run it locally" block under Tier 3 above to reproduce.
- If the failure is about the CI job's shape (marker not registered, wrong `-m`/`--strict-markers` invocation, unbounded root, timeout, empty marker family, or required-check wiring) rather than test logic, check `tests/quality/test_ci_topology.py` -- that guard pins the job's contract and its own failure message will point at what drifted.
- For hanging issues: Check command transformation in script runner (codex expects prompt content, not file paths)

## Adding New Tests

### For New Runtime Support:
1. Add a smoke test for runtime setup, marked
   `@pytest.mark.requires_runtime_<name>` (and add the marker entry to
   `_MARKER_CHECKS` in `tests/integration/conftest.py` if the runtime
   is brand new).
2. Add an E2E test for the golden scenario with the new runtime,
   marked `@pytest.mark.requires_e2e_mode` and any token markers it
   needs.
3. Update the CI matrix if the runtime introduces new platform
   support.

### For New Features:
1. Add a smoke test for compilation/validation.
2. Add an E2E test if the feature requires API calls -- pick the
   smallest set of markers that captures its real preconditions
   (`requires_github_token`, `requires_network_integration`, etc.)
   so contributors without those credentials still get a clean
   `SKIPPED` rather than a hard failure.
3. Keep tests focused and fast.
