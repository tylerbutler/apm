Inspect and maintain the local cache APM uses to avoid redundant
network I/O during dependency installs and MCP registry lookups.

## Synopsis

```bash
apm cache info
apm cache clean [--force | --yes]
apm cache prune [--days N]
```

## Description

`apm cache` groups three subcommands that operate on the local cache
root. The cache holds two independent stores:

- **Git cache** -- bare repository databases plus per-SHA worktree
  checkouts, keyed by resolved commit.
- **HTTP cache** -- conditional-GET responses for MCP registry
  endpoints.

A fresh, integrity-verified HTTP cache hit updates only the entry
directory's `mtime`. This recency marker drives LRU eviction; it does
not rewrite stored metadata or extend the response TTL. If the
`mtime` update fails, APM logs the failure at debug level and returns
the verified cached response. Stores and successful 304 refreshes
also update the directory `mtime`.

The cache is purely a performance optimization. Removing it never
breaks correctness; the next dependency install or MCP registry
lookup re-fetches whatever it needs.

Plain and frozen installs can reuse locked SHAs when upstream is unavailable.
Commands that require current state -- `apm install --update`, `apm install
--refresh`, `apm update` (including `--force`), `apm lock --update`, and `apm
outdated` -- resolve upstream first. Update may reuse content for the resolved
SHA; `--refresh` bypasses it.

## Subcommands

### `apm cache info`

Show the resolved cache root, per-store entry counts, and a size
breakdown.

```bash
apm cache info
```

Output:

```
[i] Cache root: /Users/you/Library/Caches/apm
  Git repositories (db):    12
  Git checkouts:            34
  HTTP cache entries:       87

  Total size:               142.3 MB
    Git:                    138.1 MB
    HTTP:                   4.2 MB
```

### `apm cache clean`

Remove every entry from both the git and HTTP caches. Prompts for
confirmation unless a skip flag is passed.

```bash
apm cache clean              # interactive prompt
apm cache clean --force      # non-interactive
apm cache clean --yes        # alias for --force
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--force`, `-f` | Skip the confirmation prompt. Does not suppress deletion failures or make the command succeed. |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Alias for `--force`. Use in CI scripts so the command never blocks on stdin. |

If an entry can't be deleted -- a locked file, a permissions error --
`clean` still removes every other entry, then reports the incomplete
cleanup with the affected paths and exits non-zero. Successful
removals are not rolled back. Close the process holding the lock or
fix permissions, then retry.

:::caution
`clean` removes every cached commit and every cached HTTP response.
The next dependency install or MCP registry lookup will re-fetch the
required data from the network.
Use `prune` when you only want to reclaim space from stale entries.
:::

### `apm cache prune`

Remove Git-cache SHA groups whose shared `mtime` is older than `--days N`.
Reusing a full or sparse variant refreshes the group timestamp; pruning removes
all variants. The default is 30 days. The HTTP cache is not touched.

```bash
apm cache prune              # default: older than 30 days
apm cache prune --days 7     # tighter window
```

Output counts SHA groups, not checkout variants:

```text
Pruning SHA groups older than 30 days...
Pruned 2 SHA group(s).
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--days N` | Remove SHA groups not accessed within this many days. Default: `30`. |

A recency-only permission error after successful checkout validation is
non-fatal:

```text
[!] Cannot update Git cache recency for <sha-root>: <cause>. Continuing with validated checkout; cache prune may evict it. Check cache permissions or set APM_CACHE_DIR to a writable directory.
```

Other filesystem errors and validation failures remain fatal.

:::note
`--days` accepts a nonnegative integer. Negative values are rejected
before the cache is touched. `0` makes every past entry eligible for
removal.
:::

`prune` counts only successfully deleted SHA groups and continues attempting
other stale entries after removal errors. It reports completed and failed counts
with each failed path and cause, then exits `1` if any failed; successful
deletions are not rolled back, so fix permissions or release locks and rerun the
command.

:::caution[Lockfile-blind]
`prune` does not consult project lockfiles. It can evict every variant for a
locked SHA. If the bare repository cannot rebuild the checkout, the next
install requires remote access. Freshness-required commands resolve upstream
regardless of retained cache entries.

## Cache layout

The cache root resolves in this precedence order (first match wins):

1. `APM_NO_CACHE=1` -- per-invocation temp directory, cleaned at exit.
2. `APM_CACHE_DIR=/path` -- explicit override.
3. Platform default:
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Caches/apm/`
   - **Linux:** `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/apm/`
   - **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\apm\Cache\`

Inside the cache root:

```
<cache-root>/
  git/
    db_v1/           # bare repository databases
                     #   <shard>__p/   -- blobless bare clone
                     #                    (--filter=blob:none) shared by
                     #                    full and sparse checkouts
                     #   <shard>/      -- reusable legacy full bare clone
    checkouts_v1/    # per-SHA worktree checkouts, variant-keyed
                     #   <shard>/<sha>/full/             -- full tree
                     #   <shard>/<sha>/sparse-<hash>/    -- sparse cone, or a
                     #                                     full tree when a
                     #                                     symlink target lies
                     #                                     outside the cone
                     #                                     (<hash> = first
                     #                                      16 hex of
                     #                                      sha256(paths))
  http_v1/           # conditional-GET response cache
```

New cache misses use one blobless bare for both full and sparse checkout
variants. Git hydrates the selected commit during the authenticated checkout
operation, but does not retain the upstream promisor URL in the checkout.
Existing legacy full bares remain reusable.

The `full/` and `sparse-<variant>/` subdirs let two consumers of the same commit
share storage when they want the same subdirs, and keep distinct checkout
shards when they do not. A sparse variant widens to the full tree when a
package symlink targets a tracked file excluded from the sparse cone, so that
variant can consume more disk than its name suggests.

The cache root is created with mode `0700` and validated to be
absolute with no NUL bytes before use.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `APM_CACHE_DIR` | Override the cache root. Must be an absolute path. |
| `APM_NO_CACHE` | When set to `1`, `true`, or `yes`, route all cache I/O to a temp directory cleaned at process exit. |
| `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | Honored on Linux and (when explicitly set) macOS. |

## Coming from npm?

`apm cache clean` mirrors `npm cache clean`: it nukes the local cache
and forces dependencies and registry responses to be downloaded again
when next needed. There is no `--dry-run` and no per-package targeting;
cleaning is all-or-nothing.
