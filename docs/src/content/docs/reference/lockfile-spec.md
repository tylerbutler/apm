> **Normative reference:** this page documents the v0.2 working-draft lockfile format as emitted by the current CLI. The normative, ratified contract for v0.1 is defined in [OpenAPM v0.1, Section 5 (Lockfile)](/apm/specs/openapm-v01/) and published as JSON Schema at [`lockfile-v0.1.schema.json`](/apm/specs/schemas/lockfile-v0.1.schema.json).

`apm.lock.yaml` is the pinned record of every resolved dependency and every
file APM deployed into the workspace. It is the source of truth for
reproducible installs and for drift detection. Commit it.

The pin covers the full dependency graph as it existed when APM resolved it,
including transitive package manifests. A later upstream edit to a transitive
package's `apm.yml` does not change installs that replay an existing lockfile;
APM keeps using the recorded commits until you run `apm update`, `apm lock
--update`, or delete `apm.lock.yaml` and re-run `apm install` after changing
`apm.yml`.

## Purpose

This is a **Working Draft**. The lock file format has two versions in use:
`"1"` (plain Git projects) and `"2"` (projects with at least one registry-sourced
dependency or Git semver-resolved dependency). The bump is opportunistic; see
[Version bumping](#version-bumping). Registry-sourced dependencies require the
experimental registries feature (`apm experimental enable registries`) before
install or replay.

The lockfile gives APM four things:

1. **Reproducibility.** `apm install --frozen` reinstalls the exact commits
   recorded here - no resolution, no network drift. Regular `apm install`
   also reuses locked commits for unchanged Git dependencies, including
   transitive entries, so the graph does not silently follow upstream manifest
   moves.
2. **Integrity.** Recorded SHA-256 hashes let `apm audit` detect tampering
   with deployed files.
3. **Cleanup.** The list of deployed files lets `apm prune` remove orphans
   when a dependency is dropped from `apm.yml`.
4. **Inspection.** `apm view --lock` and `apm audit` read the lockfile to
   answer "what is actually installed".

## Location

The lockfile lives at the project root next to `apm.yml`:

```
my-project/
|- apm.yml
|- apm.lock.yaml      <- here
|- apm_modules/
```

Always commit it. The lockfile is what makes a fresh clone install identically
on any machine.

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lockfile_version` | string | yes | Schema version. `"1"` for plain Git projects; `"2"` when any dependency has `source: "registry"` or Git semver resolution fields (`constraint`, `resolved_tag`, `resolved_at`). |
| _(Deprecated)_ `generated_at` | ISO 8601 string | no | Legacy write timestamp. New lockfiles omit it; when an existing lockfile carries it, APM refreshes it on substantive writes. Ignored by equivalence checks. |
| `apm_version` | string | no | APM CLI version that wrote the file. Diagnostic except for a narrow compatibility path: exact APM 0.28 metadata, a locked `marketplace_plugin` type, and a matching content hash together authorize the receipt-less cached-plugin upgrade. It never overrides canonical `apm.yml` precedence or applies to freshly fetched dependencies. |
| `dependencies` | list | yes | Resolved APM packages. See [per-entry fields](#per-entry-fields). |
| `mcp_servers` | list of strings | no | Names of MCP servers managed as of the last install or update, including transitively contributed servers. |
| `mcp_configs` | map | no | `server_name -> resolved config dict` baseline used to detect MCP drift. |
| `mcp_target_servers` | map of string lists | no | `target -> server names` for MCP entries APM successfully wrote. Reinstall and uninstall use this ownership record to remove only APM-managed entries. An explicitly empty map authorizes no cleanup. Older lockfiles without this field adopt an existing self-defined native entry only when it exactly matches the stored `mcp_configs` baseline; registry-resolved and user-edited entries remain unowned. |
| `mcp_config_provenance` | map | no | `server_name -> declaring package` for transitively contributed MCP servers. Used to identify the former owner in `config-consistency` diagnostics; it never exempts a lock-only entry. |
| `lsp_servers` | list of strings | no | Names of all LSP servers in current APM-managed state, including package- and bundle-contributed servers. |
| `lsp_configs` | map | no | `server_name -> resolved config dict` retained for owner-aware lifecycle reconciliation. It is not an `apm audit` drift baseline. |
| `lsp_target_servers` | map of string lists | no | `target -> server names` for LSP entries APM successfully wrote. Reinstall and uninstall use this ownership record to remove stale executable entries without claiming legacy or user-owned content. |
| `lsp_config_provenance` | map of strings | no | `server_name -> declaration owner` using `project:.`, `package:<identity>`, or `bundle:<identity>`. Reconciliation uses this field to preserve bundle and surviving-package entries while removing departed owners. |
| `local_deployed_files` | list | no | Files this project itself contributes (sources its own primitives). Reinstall reconciles these paths with the same target rules as per-dependency `deployed_files`. See [self entry](#self-entry). |
| `local_deployed_file_hashes` | map | no | `path -> sha256` for `local_deployed_files`. |
| `deployments` | list | no | Canonical deployment ownership rows, additive alongside the legacy `deployed_files`/`local_deployed_files` views. See [Canonical deployment rows](#canonical-deployment-rows). |

## Canonical deployment rows

Each item in `deployments` is one locator -- one deployed file or native
runtime entry -- with its full ownership history:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | string | Locator storage form: `project-relative`, `target-relative`, or `uri` (e.g. an MCP server entry). |
| `target` | string | Deploy target name (`copilot`, `claude`, `mcp`, etc.). |
| `value` | string | The path (relative to its `kind`) or URI value. |
| `runtime` | string or null | Runtime scoping the row, when applicable (e.g. an MCP client name). |
| `scope` | string | Install scope, typically `project`. |
| `owners` | list of strings | Every dependency key that has ever claimed this locator, oldest to newest. |
| `active_owner` | string | The current claimant. Always one of `owners`; a row where it is not is malformed. |
| `content_hash` | string or null | `sha256:<hex>` digest of the deployed content, when known. |

`owners` and `active_owner` must each resolve to a member of the **valid
owner universe** for that lockfile: every current key in `dependencies`,
the workspace self-owner `.`, or `local-bundle` (imperative content added
outside the replayable install pipeline, e.g. `apm unpack`). A reference to
a dependency key no longer present in `dependencies` is a stale owner --
`apm audit` reports it as `deployment-ledger-owners` and `apm prune`
repairs it; see [Baseline checks](../baseline-checks/#deployment-ledger-owners)
and [`apm prune`](../cli/prune/#canonical-deployment-ownership).

`deployments` is the canonical source APM writes to going forward. The
per-dependency `deployed_files`/`deployed_file_hashes` and the top-level
`local_deployed_files`/`local_deployed_file_hashes`/`mcp_target_servers`/
`lsp_target_servers` fields remain on disk as derived, one-cycle-compatible
legacy views of the same ledger -- older tooling that only reads the flat
fields still sees a consistent projection. Author neither view by hand; both
are written by `apm install`, `apm prune`, and related commands.

## Per-entry fields

Each item in `dependencies` describes one resolved package.

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `repo_url` | string | yes | Canonical repository path or URL. Entry identity is derived from `repo_url`, `host`, and virtual/local markers; see [lockfile identity keys](#lockfile-identity-keys). |
| `materialization_repo_url` | string | no | Source-cased path that preserves repository display spelling when APM reconstructs the dependency, including for `apm_modules/` materialization and generated links. Omitted when it equals `repo_url`; it must normalize to the same identity and cannot redirect a lock entry. |
| `host` | string | no | FQDN when not inferable from `repo_url` (e.g. for registry proxies or non-GitHub hosts). |
| `host_type` | string | no | Explicit host-kind hint, currently `gitlab`, copied from object-form `type: gitlab`. |
| `port` | int | no | Non-standard SSH/HTTPS port. Validated to `1..65535` on read. |
| `registry_prefix` | string | no | URL path prefix when resolved through a registry proxy (e.g. `artifactory/github`). |
| `resolved_ref` | string | no | The user-supplied ref from `apm.yml` (`main`, `v1.2.0`, a SHA). |
| `resolved_commit` | string | no | Exact 40-char commit SHA installed. The pin. |
| `name` | string | no | Package name as declared in the dependency's own `apm.yml` at resolution time. For `package_type: claude_skill`, the name comes from `SKILL.md` frontmatter with the directory name as fallback. **SELF-ASSERTED** author-claim metadata -- NOT integrity-verified and MUST NOT be used for trust decisions or identity keying. Always cross-reference `repo_url` + `resolved_commit` (or `resolved_hash`) for provenance. Omitted when absent. |
| `version` | string | no | Resolved package version. For registry entries: the exact version selected from the registry for reinstall; `resolved_hash` remains the integrity anchor. For git/local entries: the `version` field from the dependency's `apm.yml` at resolution time (display/inventory metadata only -- replay always uses `resolved_ref`/`resolved_commit`). For `package_type: claude_skill` (which has no `apm.yml`), the value is always `unknown`. For git-semver entries: the resolved semver version. **SELF-ASSERTED** for git/local entries; see `name` boundary note above. |
| `virtual_path` | string | no | Subpath inside the repo for virtual packages (monorepo subpaths). |
| `is_virtual` | bool | no | `true` when the entry is a virtual subpath package. |
| `depth` | int | no | Position in the dependency tree. `0` is the project itself, `1` is a direct dep, higher is transitive. Defaults to `1`. |
| `resolved_by` | string | no | `repo_url` of the parent that pulled this transitive dep. Absent for direct deps. Rewritten by `apm uninstall` when a rescued transitive dependency's original parent is removed, so the entry stays keyed on a genuine surviving parent -- this never changes the entry's identity or lock key, only which parent it points to. |
| `package_type` | string | no | Kind of package: `apm_package`, `skill_bundle`, `claude_skill`, `hook_package`, `hybrid`, `marketplace_plugin`. Drives target placement. |
| `skill_subset` | list of strings | no | For dependencies that expose selectable skills: the sorted subset of skill names the manifest selected. Empty means "all". |
| `target_subset` | list of strings | no | Sorted target names selected by a dependency's `targets:` subset. Empty means "all active install targets". |
| `deployed_files` | list of strings | no | Sorted project-relative paths APM wrote for this dependency; powers `prune` and `audit`'s file-presence check. Shared paths have one canonical owner; uninstall transfers ownership to a surviving provider. Reinstall preserves other declared, gated, or dynamic targets' entries. On explicit manifest contraction, install/prune removes dropped targets' files only if recorded hashes match; edited files remain tracked on disk. `apm lock` preserves files and their `deployed_files`, `deployed_file_hashes`, and deployment-ledger rows until normal install can verify and perform cleanup. Without `targets:` or `target:` in the consumer's `apm.yml`, reinstall preserves inactive targets' deployed files, merge-hook configuration, and ownership sidecars, even with `--target`. A `--target` override does not declare dropped targets; only explicit manifest contraction permits pruning them. |
| `deployed_file_hashes` | map | no | `path -> sha256` for the files in `deployed_files`. Powers `audit`'s content-integrity check. Hashed over canonical content -- UTF-8 text is normalized CRLF -> LF (bare CR preserved) so the hash is the same whether git checks the file out with Windows or POSIX line endings; binary is hashed raw. Directory entries (trailing `/`) have no hash. |
| `exec_status` | string | no | Executable-trust state of this dep's executable primitives, set by the install-time gate via the shared deny-wins resolver. One of `deployed` (trusted and materialized), `gated_pending_approval` (present but parked until approved), `denied` (blocked by an org/user deny), or `absent` (declares no executables). Consumed by `audit`'s `required-executable-untrusted` signal; see [Executable approval](../cli/approve/). |
| `source` | string | no | `"local"` for path dependencies, `"registry"` for dedicated-registry resolutions. Absent for Git deps. |
| `resolved_url` | string | registry only | Fully-qualified download URL used to re-fetch registry archives. |
| `resolved_hash` | string | registry only | SHA-256 digest of the registry archive bytes, verified on every install. |
| `local_path` | string | no | Original path from `apm.yml` for local deps, relative to project root. |
| `content_hash` | string | no | SHA-256 of the materialized package tree, computed from sorted relative paths and raw file bytes. GitCache-backed git-subpath checkouts pin `core.autocrlf=false` so LF-committed content is not rewritten as CRLF on checkout; this pin does not override `.gitattributes` or `core.eol`. Bytes that are committed as CRLF stay CRLF. For remote dependencies it verifies that downloaded or cached content still matches the lock; for local path dependencies it detects source-tree changes. |
| `is_dev` | bool | no | `true` when the dep was declared under `devDependencies`. |
| `discovered_via` | string | no | Marketplace name that surfaced this package (provenance). |
| `marketplace_plugin_name` | string | no | Plugin name as listed in that marketplace. |
| `source_url` | string | no | Canonical marketplace source URL when the package came from a hosted `marketplace.json` catalog. |
| `source_digest` | string | no | `sha256:<hex>` digest of the hosted `marketplace.json` bytes used for resolution. |
| `is_insecure` | bool | no | `true` when the source URL was `http://`. |
| `allow_insecure` | bool | no | `true` when the manifest explicitly opted in to the insecure source. |
| `constraint` | string | git-source semver only | The original semver range from `apm.yml` (`^1.2.0`, `~1.4`). Present when `ref:` was a range; used by drift detection so a manifest range vs. a locked tag (`v1.5.3`) is not a false positive, and by lockfile replay to pin the resolved tag deterministically across installs. |
| `resolved_tag` | string | git-source semver or SHA-pin updates | The concrete annotated git tag (`v1.5.3`, `widget--v1.5.3`) that satisfied `constraint` or justified the latest full-SHA revision-pin update. |
| `resolved_at` | string | git-source semver only | RFC 3339 timestamp of the resolution. Surfaces "how stale is this pin?" in `apm why`. |
| `declared_license` | string | no | The license the package *manifest declares* (`license:` in `apm.yml`, or `license` in a `plugin.json`), recorded verbatim at resolve time and syntax-validated offline against the bundled SPDX id set. An author **claim**, not a conclusion from `LICENSE` text -- APM never reads the license file. Omitted when undeclared (absence means unknown; no sentinel is stored). Surfaced by `apm lock export`. |

Fields are emitted only when set. A minimal entry is just `repo_url` plus
`resolved_commit`.

Azure DevOps uses the same generic `host` and `repo_url` fields as every other
Git provider. APM derives its transient organization, project, and repository
coordinates when reconstructing the dependency reference; no ADO-specific
fields are persisted.

## Lockfile identity keys

Lockfile dependency keys keep `github.com` implicit for migration stability:
existing `github.com` entries remain keyed as `owner/repo`. Local dependencies
use `local_path` directly. Virtual dependencies append `virtual_path` to the
base repo key. Entries for non-default hosts prefix the key with the lowercased
host (`host/owner/repo`), so `github.com/team/skills` and
`gitea.myorg.com/team/skills` can coexist without overwriting each other, and
host casing cannot create duplicate keys. Registry-proxy entries keep the bare
logical key because the proxy host is transport, not package identity.

GitHub and package-registry owner/repository paths are lowercased before APM
derives the key. Older mixed-case GitHub entries therefore serialize with the
same key as new lowercase references. Their source spelling is retained
separately in `materialization_repo_url`, so filesystem paths and relative links
do not reuse the lowercase comparison key. Repository path casing remains
identity-significant for unknown git hosts because those backends may be
case-sensitive.

## Self entry

A project that ships its own primitives (skills, agents, prompts under
`.github/`, `.claude/`, etc.) records the files it deploys to its own targets
under `local_deployed_files` and `local_deployed_file_hashes` at the top
level.

Internally, when the lockfile is loaded, APM synthesizes a virtual dependency
entry keyed by `"."` so that orphan detection, audit, and prune can iterate
all "owned" files uniformly. This synthesized entry has:

- `repo_url: <self>`
- `source: local`
- `local_path: "."`
- `depth: 0`
- `is_dev: true`
- `deployed_files` and `deployed_file_hashes` copied from the top-level
  `local_deployed_*` fields.

The synthesized entry is **not** written back to YAML - the flat
`local_deployed_*` fields remain the on-disk source of truth. Treat the self
entry as an implementation detail; do not author it by hand.

## Version bumping

The lock file uses two schema versions:

| Version | Triggered by | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| `"1"` | Default for Git-only projects. | Baseline schema. |
| `"2"` | Any dependency with `source: "registry"` or Git semver resolution fields. | `resolved_url`, `resolved_hash`, and registry `version`; `constraint`, `resolved_tag`, and `resolved_at` for Git semver pins. |

The bump is **opportunistic**: a project that never opts into a registry keeps
`lockfile_version: "1"` forever, even on a newer client. The first registry
dep added to the graph promotes the lockfile to `"2"`; if every registry dep is
later removed, the next write demotes back to `"1"`. Both versions are valid
on-disk formats; consumers MUST handle either.

For the registry workflow this enables, see the [Registries guide](../../guides/registries/).

## Pack section

When a project is packed with `apm pack`, the bundled lockfile is enriched
with a top-level `pack:` block:

```yaml
pack:
  format: apm           # or "plugin"
  target: copilot       # or comma-joined list, or "all"
  packed_at: "2026-05-10T20:14:00+00:00"
  mapped_from:          # only when cross-target path remapping happened
    - .claude/skills/
  bundle_files:         # only for plugin bundles
    skills/my-skill/SKILL.md: "a1b2..."
```

The pack block is read by `apm unpack` to verify bundle integrity and to
restore correct target paths. It is stripped from project lockfiles and only
appears inside packed bundles.

`local_deployed_files` and `local_deployed_file_hashes` are stripped from
bundle lockfiles - they describe the packager's own repo, which is not
shipped.

## Lifecycle

| Command | Reads | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `apm install` | existing lockfile (for `--frozen` and incremental reuse) | full rewrite on resolution change |
| `apm install --frozen` | required | never writes; fails on a missing pin or MCP config/server-name drift |
| `apm compile` | yes (resolution + integrity) | no |
| `apm audit` | yes | no |
| `apm prune` | yes (orphans and `deployments` ownership, even with nothing else to prune) | yes (after removing orphans and reconciling `deployments`) |
| `apm view --lock` | yes | no |
| `apm unpack` | bundle's pack-enriched lockfile | merges into project lockfile |

`apm install` only rewrites the file when its semantic content changes
(`generated_at` and `apm_version` are ignored when comparing). A no-op install
leaves the file untouched. New lockfiles omit `generated_at` so independent
dependency changes do not manufacture timestamp conflicts. If a pre-existing
lockfile includes the field, APM retains it for compatibility and refreshes it
only on a substantive write. To migrate a legacy lockfile manually, delete the
`generated_at: ...` line from `apm.lock.yaml` once; APM will not add it back.

## Drift and integrity

The lockfile is what `apm audit` compares the workspace against. Each baseline
check maps to specific lockfile fields:

| Check | Backed by |
|---|---|
| `deployment-ledger-owners` | `deployments` rows' `owners` and `active_owner` vs. the valid owner universe |
| `lockfile-exists` | file presence at project root |
| `ref-consistency` | `resolved_ref` per entry vs. `apm.yml` |
| `deployed-files-present` | `deployed_files` per entry (and self entry) |
| `content-integrity` | `deployed_file_hashes` (and `local_deployed_file_hashes`) |
| `skill-subset-consistency` | `skill_subset` per entry, matched against `apm.yml` and the resolved package tree |
| `config-consistency` | `mcp_configs` and `mcp_config_provenance` |
| `no-orphaned-packages` | `dependencies` keys vs. `apm.yml` |

Files listed in `deployed_files` without a corresponding hash entry (typically
directory markers ending in `/`) are skipped by content-integrity. Missing
files are reported by `deployed-files-present`, not by content-integrity, so
the two checks do not double-count.

Orphan detection works in two directions:

- **Orphan packages** - entries in `dependencies` that the manifest no longer
  declares. `apm prune` removes them and their `deployed_files`.
- **Orphan files** - files under managed target directories that no lockfile
  entry claims. `apm prune` removes them too.

`apm prune` is the only command that reconciles `deployments` rows. The valid
owner universe and metadata-only repair boundary are defined in
[Canonical deployment rows](#canonical-deployment-rows); cleanup behavior is
documented under [`apm prune`](../cli/prune/#canonical-deployment-ownership).

## Versioning

`lockfile_version` is the schema version of the file format itself.

- The current versions are `"1"` and `"2"`; version `"2"` is emitted for registry-sourced or git-semver-resolved dependencies.
- APM additively extends entries within each version - new optional fields
  may appear without bumping the version. Older APM clients ignore unknown
  fields.
- Breaking changes (renames, removals, semantic shifts) require bumping
  `lockfile_version`. APM refuses to operate on a lockfile whose version it
  does not recognize, and will instruct the user to upgrade or regenerate.

Invalid YAML, an unsupported explicit version, an empty or non-mapping root,
malformed container fields, and invalid deployment rows fail closed before APM
constructs lock state. Pre-versioned legacy files migrate as v1 inputs. Fix or
remove other invalid files explicitly; APM does not silently replace them with
an empty lockfile.

## Example

A small project with one remote APM package, one MCP server, and its own
local skill:
