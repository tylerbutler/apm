"""Thin rule catalog for install/deployment architecture checks.

Owns no check-function bodies of its own: every ``check=`` reference below
resolves to a cohesive check-family module (request/source, frozen/audit,
base-integrator/contraction, uninstall/resolution, package-target-
authorization) or to :mod:`scripts.architecture_linter.checks.install_policy_intent`'s
``EXTRA_RULES`` splice (AC3 policy authorities, AC4 declared intent, AC7
mutation locking). Kept as its own module -- rather than folded into any one
check-family file -- purely so this rule catalog's own historical, non-
physical ordering (a rule's registration position here does not follow its
check function's definition order) stays visible and auditable in one place.
