"""Lockfile assembly: build a ``LockFile`` from install artefacts.

This module hosts the ``LockfileBuilder`` that assembles a
:class:`~apm_cli.deps.lockfile.LockFile` from the artefacts produced by
earlier install phases (deployed files, types, hashes, marketplace
provenance, dependency graph).

Exposes:

- ``compute_deployed_hashes()`` -- per-file content-hash helper
  relocated from ``commands/install.py`` (:pypi:`#762`).
- ``LockfileBuilder`` -- assembles and persists the lockfile from
  :class:`~apm_cli.install.context.InstallContext` state (P2.S6).
