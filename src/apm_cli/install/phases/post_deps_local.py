"""Post-deps local content: stale cleanup + lockfile persistence.

Handles the second half of the local ``.apm/`` content integration
lifecycle that was previously an inline block in the Click ``install()``
handler (lines 653-795 pre-F3).  The first half -- actually deploying
the primitives -- is handled by ``_integrate_root_project`` in the
``integrate`` phase.

Two responsibilities:

1. **Stale cleanup** -- remove files deployed by a *previous* local
   integration that are no longer produced.  Only runs when the
   current integration completed without errors (avoids deleting files
   that failed to re-deploy).  All deletions route through the
   canonical security chokepoint
   ``apm_cli.integration.cleanup.remove_stale_deployed_files`` (PR #762).

2. **Lockfile persistence** -- update the run-scoped lockfile snapshot to persist
   ``local_deployed_files`` and per-file content hashes.  Runs after the
   dep lockfile phase has already written dependency data; this phase
   simply augments the on-disk lockfile with the local fields.

Scope guard: this phase only runs for ``InstallScope.PROJECT``.  User-
scope installs do not track local deployed files (matching pre-refactor
behavior).
