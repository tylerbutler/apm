"""End-to-end proof that a lockfile-seeded warm resolve makes ZERO commits-API calls.

Companion to the resolver-unit tests in
``tests/unit/deps/test_tiered_ref_resolver.py`` and the seed-phase unit tests in
``tests/unit/install/phases/test_resolve_seed_from_lockfile.py``. Those exercise
``TieredRefResolver.seed`` and ``seed_ref_resolver_from_lockfile`` in isolation
against hand-built tier mocks / fake resolvers.

This module instead drives the claim through the REAL production wiring:

* the real :func:`seed_ref_resolver_from_lockfile` install-phase step,
* a real :class:`LockFile` / :class:`LockedDependency`,
* a real tier stack from :func:`build_tiered_ref_resolver` (L0 per-run cache ->
  L1 commits API -> L2 bare rev-parse -> L3 legacy clone), and
* the real :meth:`GitHubPackageDownloader.resolve_git_reference` facade that the
  install/update/outdated code paths call.

Only the innermost network seam -- the legacy
:class:`GitReferenceResolver` reached via ``downloader._refs`` -- is faked, so no
live GitHub commits API call or git clone ever runs. The fake counts the two
network entry points (``resolve_commit_sha_for_ref`` = commits API tier,
``resolve`` = legacy clone tier) so the test can assert ``commits_api == 0`` on
the warm, seeded path and prove the same resolve WOULD hit the commits API
without the seed (regression trap).
