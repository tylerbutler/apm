"""Tier-2 smoke tests against the built apm binary.

Purpose
-------
Fail fast in the merge queue BEFORE the 30-minute heavy integration
suite runs, by exercising the CLI surface that the README's "three
promises" actually advertise:

    1. Portable by manifest -- ``apm init``, ``apm install``,
       ``apm compile``.
    2. Secure by default    -- ``apm audit``.
    3. Governed by policy   -- ``apm policy status`` runs discovery.

Scope rules
-----------
- Hermetic: NO network calls. No GitHub API, no marketplace fetch,
  no runtime-binary install. The fixture project declares zero
  remote dependencies so ``apm install`` exercises the install
  pipeline as a no-op rather than going to the network.
- Fast: the whole module must run in well under a minute on a fresh
  GitHub-hosted runner. Each subprocess uses a 60-second cap.
- Sanity, not coverage: this module deliberately does NOT verify
  exact compiled paths, target-detection branching, or policy
  enforcement semantics. Those belong in the heavy integration
  suite. The smoke job just answers "does the binary start, does
  each core command pipeline run end-to-end and exit cleanly".
- Aligned to README: every test in this module maps to one of the
  three promises in ``README.md``. ``apm run`` and ``apm runtime``
  are explicitly experimental (``--help`` text says so) and live
  in ``test_runtime_smoke.py`` under ``requires_runtime_*`` markers
  in the heavy suite, not here.

Markers
-------
- ``requires_e2e_mode`` -- gates on ``APM_E2E_TESTS=1`` so a casual
  ``pytest tests/integration/`` does not shell out.
- ``requires_apm_binary`` -- gates on the resolved binary path so
  the module is skipped (not failed) on a contributor laptop that
  has no local build.
